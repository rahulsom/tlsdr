Running the Vagrant machine
---

1. Install Vagrant (and VirtualBox)
2. Run this to setup your box
```bash
vagrant up && vagrant ssh
```
3. Profit!

Creating PCAPs for testing
---
Once SSHed into the vagrant box, run this

```bash
sudo su -
cd /vagrant/test
./bootstrap.sh
```

The Certificate Authorities
---
There are 2 certificate authorities created using carb

    /vagrant/test/goodca
    /vagrant/test/badca

Both have a password of `tlsdr`.

The Certificates
---
When we say certificate in this section, we actually mean certificate+key pair.

```
goodca
  - trusted    (CN:trusted.demo.com)
  - mutual     (CN:mutual.demo.com)
  - goodclient (CN:goodclient)
badca
  - bad        (CN:bad.demo.com)
  - badclient  (CN:badclient)
```

The development environment
---
This project uses [gom](https://github.com/mattn/gom) for dependency management.

1. If you haven't already, set your $GOPATH
2. Make sure $GOPATH/bin is in your $PATH
3. Go Get gom
```bash
go get github.com/mattn/gom
```
4. Say `gom` when you mean `go`. E.g.
```
gom run tlsdr.go
```
5. When you need new dependencies, modify `Gomfile`
